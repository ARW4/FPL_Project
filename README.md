## API 🛜
It was chalolanging to find the documentation for the FPL API however i was able to find information through others that have already connect to it. 
My main source of information regarding the API was [https://www.game-change.co.uk/2023/02/10/a-complete-guide-to-the-fantasy-premier-league-fpl-api/#google_vignette.](https://www.oliverlooney.com/blogs/FPL-APIs-Explained)

Using the link a list of endpoints can be found with the data that is included in each endpoint. For the purpose of this project I did not use any endpoints that gave data regarding specific leagues or users teams.
