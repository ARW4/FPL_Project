**An FPL data project using R, Github Actions and Tableau**
<br>
The aim of this project was to create an automated data pipeline that would download data from the Premier Leagues FPL API, transform it using R and then push the data to a tableau dashboard that is uploaded on Tableau Public. Resulting in a Tableau Public Dashboard that updates automatically on a daily basis.
